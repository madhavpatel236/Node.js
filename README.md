### In this repository we learn the backend in detail with the use of the NodeJS, ExpressJs, MongoDB and many more things.

- #### Before start the code we need to understand the some concepts in details so we make a saperate folder `/Core Concepts Notes`. In this folder we have all the concepts in details with the Notes.

- #### Now we start the new project which is Beyond the Bit, for that we have saperate folder for the forntend and backend.

# Beyond the Bit

## üöÄ Overview

Developer Connect is a unique matchmaking app tailored for software developers to build meaningful connections, collaborate on ideas, and grow their networks.

Built using the MERN stack, this project combines secure authentication, dynamic APIs, and advanced backend functionalities to deliver a seamless user experience. Beyond its features, this repository reflects my journey of mastering core backend concepts and applying them in a real-world application.

## üåü Backend Features

- Advanced Schema Design: Implemented MongoDB Schemas and Models using Mongoose.

- Schema Methods: Added custom methods for operations like token generation.

- Schema Hooks: Used schema.pre("save") for pre-save data processing.
Secure Authentication

- Password Encryption: Utilized bcrypt for hashing sensitive data.

- JWT Integration: Used jwt.sign() for secure token-based authentication.

- Cookie Management: Set and managed cookies to store tokens securely.
Dynamic APIs

- Created RESTful APIs using Express for GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH operations.

- Implemented dynamic routing with .params for URL-based data retrieval.
Optimized Database Queries

- Indexing: Applied single and compound indexes for faster query execution.

- Query Chaining: Used MongoDB query chaining for efficient data filtering.

- Pagination: Implemented .limit() and .skip() for paginated results.
Advanced Mongoose Features

- Custom middleware for profile route validation and request handling.
Efficient use of express.Router() for modular routing.


## üåü Frontend Features

- React Functional Components for a modern user interface.

- React Router for dynamic page transitions.

- Redux Toolkit for managing state across the app.

- Tailwind CSS for sleek, responsive styling.
